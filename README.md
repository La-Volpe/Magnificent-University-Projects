# Magnificent University Projects
## What is this?
I study CS in IAUCTB and I plan to share every practice and example code (mostly C/C++) I write here. these code are not very practical. they have educational purpose.

## Contributing
You can help by commiting new code or improving the existing codes. just keep in mind these have educational purpose so keep it simple please! contributing to the [wiki](https://github.com/mohsend/cpp-examples/wiki/) is also very much appreciated.

## Compiling
### GNU Compiler Collection
I tested every file using [GCC](https://github.com/mohsend/cpp-examples/wiki/GNU-Compiler-Collection) on Ubuntu. any compiler should be fine.

To [compile in *nix](https://github.com/mohsend/cpp-examples/wiki/Compiling-using-GCC) (Linux, OS X, freeBSD,...) using GCC run this command in terminal:
```bash
g++ -Wall code_file.cpp
```
And then you can run the compiled executable by running:
```bash
./a.out
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio .net
Add this line on top of the code if you want to compile in Visual Studio .net:
```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
```
