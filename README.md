## Compiling
### GNU Compiler Collection
I tested every file using GCC on Ubuntu. any compiler should be fine.

To compile in Linux using GCC run this command in terminal:
```bash
g++ -Wall -o "executable_file" "code_file.cpp"
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio
Add this line on top of the code if you want to compile in Visual Studio:
```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
```
