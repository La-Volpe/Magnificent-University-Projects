# C++ Example codes
## What is this?
I study CS in IAUCTB. I plan to share every practice and example C++ code I write here. these code are not very peractical. they have educational purpose.

## Contributing
You can help by commiting new code or improving the existing codes. just keep in mind these have educational purpose so keep it simple please!

## Compiling
I tested every file using GCC on Ubuntu. any compiler should be fine.

To compile in Linux using GCC run this command in terminal:
```bash
g++ -Wall -o "executable_file" "code_file.cpp"
```

some files have a Visual Studio specific line. simply delete the line if you want to complie using another compliler. or add it if you want to compile in VS.
```c++
#include "stdafx.h"
```
